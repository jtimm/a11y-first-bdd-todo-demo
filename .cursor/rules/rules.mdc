# Rules for a11y-first-bdd-todo-demo repository

This repository is an accessibility-first BDD ToDo demo, focusing on robust
and maintainable end-to-end testing with Playwright, BDD, and semantic UI.

## GENERAL GUIDELINES:

1.  Prioritize accessibility locators (`role`, `name`) when interacting with the UI
    in tests. Avoid brittle CSS selectors.
2.  All UI components should use native HTML semantics primarily, with ARIA
    only used when absolutely necessary to enhance accessibility.
3.  Test scenarios are defined in Gherkin (`.feature` files) and should be
    treated as executable documentation.
4.  When writing or modifying tests, leverage the existing generic step
    definitions and modular utilities (`a11y.ts`, `waiters.ts`) to maintain
    consistency and scalability.
5.  For synchronization in tests, use "suffix waits" (e.g., "...and wait for
    the spinner to disappear") that map to Playwright wait conditions,
    instead of arbitrary timeouts.
